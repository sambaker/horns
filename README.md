An app to render scales and other things on trombone position charts.

Built using the yeoman angular generator.

Demo available at: http://horncharts.dreamhosters.com/#/

*New*: Trumpet support showing valve positions. Probably not useful for trumpet players but maybe useful for trombone players learning trumpet.
